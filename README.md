# Daily Agenda

## Description

This mobile-first app was built out to experiment with technologies I have not yet worked with - Ionic and Firebase. Users can register an account, log in, and add or remove items from their daily to-do list.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Ionic
- Firebase

## Future Plans

- Allow the user to keep more than one list
- Set a time to start (or complete) each task, send push notifications to remind the user
- Fine-tune the visual aesthetic
