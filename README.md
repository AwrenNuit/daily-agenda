# Daily Agenda

## Description

This mobile-first app was built out to experiment with technologies I have not yet worked with - Ionic and Firebase. Users can register an account, log in, and add or remove items from their daily to-do list.

## Technologies Used

- React
- React-Redux
- Ionic
- Firebase

## Installation

- Download or clone this repository
- Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- `npm init -y` from command line
- `npm i -g @ionic/cli` from command line to install Ionic
- `npm i -g create-react-app` from command line to install React
- `npm i` from command line to install project dependencies
- `npm start` to run the project

## Future Plans

- Allow the user to keep more than one list
- Set a time to start (or complete) each task, send push notifications to remind the user
- Hide the navbar on Login and Register screens
- Fix checkbox task duplication
- Fine-tune the visual aesthetic
